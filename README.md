# MUMT307 Final Project: Implementation of Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) for Speech Synthesis

This is a repository with all my code for my final project for MUMT307: Music and Audio Computing II (McGill University, Winter 2022). In this project, I implemented a speech synthesizer algorithm in MATLAB using Linear Predictive Coding (LPC). It includes the project report, the LPC script, and two example input audio files to test out the algorithm. [Click here for the supporting report](corinnedarche.github.io/MUMT307_FinalProject).
